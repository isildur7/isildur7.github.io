Just finished writing an academic paper. This wasn't the first paper that I was involved in, but the first for which I was the lead writer. It was a very tight deadline, but happy that we could meet it. I always thought that I need to work on my writing skills and this was a particularly rewarding experience to that end. Now, hopefully it will pass the reviews. Fingers crossed!

I haven't found the time yet to finish building my research page, but I should probably get it done by the end of the month.
